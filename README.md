## Budget Calendar

_What makes this budget calendar different?_

This calendar is able to create recurring expenses for yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily. 

_why is this exciting?_

Its how these expenses are calculated and accounted for within a budget range. This feature allows people who geet paid on a certain day of the month to accurately track the number of days left in that pay cycle and only count expenses that exist in that cycle.
Other applications base it on the whole month so at the start of a new month it's hard to see how much you actually have since any recurring expenses are taken out all at once. 

This budget tracker is the only tracker that is able to calculate and track singular and recurring expenses within a range of time.
